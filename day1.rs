    /*  Think of macros like templates or shortcuts. Instead of repeating code or writing generic logic by hand, you can define a macro once and use it many times.

        There are two types of macros in Rust:
            Declarative macros: macro_rules! â€” rule-based
            Procedural macros: More advanced; they take Rust code as input and output Rust code (like plugins)

    // generally, functions take params but macros consume code so technically it's a code that writes code
    // macros are invoked with a ! at the end, like println!
