# Everust ðŸ¦€

My daily Rust learning journey - documenting progress, experiments, and discoveries as I master the Rust programming language.

## About This Repository

This repository contains my daily learnings, practice code, and experiments with Rust. Each day, I explore different aspects of Rust programming and document my progress here.


## Daily Learning Format

Each day's entry includes:
- **Concept studied**: What I learned today
- **Code examples**: Practical implementations
- **Challenges faced**: Problems encountered and solutions
- **Key takeaways**: Important insights and notes
- **Tomorrow's plan**: What to study next

## Current Progress

- **Day 1**: [Brief summary of what was learned]
- **Day 2**: [Brief summary of what was learned]
- **Day 3**: [Brief summary of what was learned]
