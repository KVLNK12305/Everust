## 🗓️ Day 1 Learnings: Chapter 1 - Getting Started

Chapter 1 of "The Rust Programming Language" focuses on setting up your Rust development environment and writing your first Rust programs. This section outlines my findings from day one.

### 1.1 Installation

To kick off with Rust, you'll install `rustup`, the official Rust toolchain installer. `rustup` is your go-to for managing various Rust versions and associated tools. You can find the detailed installation instructions in "The Book."

### 1.2 Hello, World! & The `println!` Macro ✨

This section walks you through crafting your very first "Hello, World!" program in Rust, covering its basic structure and how to compile and run it.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
